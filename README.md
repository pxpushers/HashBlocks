What's good yall it's AKLO just cooked up this lil donut to get my hands dirty with three.js and recursion. 

HashBlocks is a Bitcoin art generator that creates a new three.js art piece every 10 minutes based in the latest block hash, height and timestamp. The first HashBlock of every day (UTC time) is a monochrome rare. It's a super simple minimal single html file that can be inscribed on-chain, just plan on adding a few more features first including Orbit Controls and a GLB export / inscribe feature, so that anyone can download the generative sculpture or even inscribe it on chain and claim ownership on a first come first serve basis. Only one HashBlock can be inscribed per block, any duplicates will be ignored. Open source & CC0, this was just a mini experiment so I can get better as a n00b dev.
